# Box template slim
Now this is the only one available template.
The other template was composed by multiple files for each phase (recon, service enum, exploitation, privesc, post exploitation, loot).
The main reason for this one to exist is I wanted something within just one file that for the moment it'll be called *walkthrough*.

While the logical order is quite obvious, I suggest you to fill the *Post exploitation* section as you proceed with your privesc. Then, once you get root, you only need to change/add the info inside this part.

The `x.x.x.x` file is intended to represent the target's IP, so you should rename it with that IP.

**Remember that I use Obsidian as note-taking application, so my notes are structured to be useful inside it. **
