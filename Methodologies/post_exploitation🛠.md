# Post exploitation ðŸ› 
"It's not over till it's over"
Ok, you got root, good job! Now you can start working.
The exploitation and privesc phases are important, but do not underestimate this one. An host that only you can reach, that has not got anything interesting inside and that is not useful for pivoting.. well **generally** that is not good for your pentesting (It depends on assignment).

During this phase, you should gather additional information about your target, in order to:
- Get pesistence
- Loot, loot and loot
- Better analyze the infrastructure
- Find high value targets/business impact targets
- Cover tracks
- Pivot

For the sake of the OSCP exam, we'll go just for the loot point. The rest of the points is going to be fulfilled in the future.

## Harvest 'em all!
Take a deep breath and start gather as much useful and interesting information as possibile.
